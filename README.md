# intro_estat

This repository contains exercises, examples, and Jupyter notebooks developed as part of activities as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the Introductory Statistics 2025 course for ImpaTech.

The materials are designed to support students in:

- Understanding core statistical concepts (descriptive statistics, probability, inference, etc.)

- Practicing problem-solving through guided exercises

- Exploring computational approaches using Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)

- Connecting theoretical content with applied examples
